## Introduction

Data structures are essential tools for organizing and managing data in computer programs. They enable efficient data access, insertion, deletion, and manipulation. Understanding and implementing data structures can improve algorithm efficiency and overall program performance.

This repository aims to provide clear and well-documented implementations of various data structures using JavaScript. Each data structure is presented with its implementation details, time complexities, and use cases to help developers better understand and utilize them in their projects.

## Available Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures are available in this repository:

1. **Array**: A dynamic array implementation that automatically resizes as needed.
2. **Hash Table**: A hash table that stores key-value pairs and supports fast retrieval.
3. **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows push and pop operations.
4. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
5. **Graph**: An implementation of a directed graph using adjacency lists.
6. **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree data structure with efficient searching and insertion.
7. **Heaps**: Implementation of Min Heap and Max Heap data structures.
8. **Linked List**: A singly linked list that supports insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Each data structure is organized in its own module and includes examples showcasing their usage.
