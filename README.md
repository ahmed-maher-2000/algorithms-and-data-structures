## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. Data structures allow us to organize and manage data efficiently, while algorithms provide methods for solving problems using that data. Understanding both data structures and algorithms is essential for writing efficient and effective code.

This repository aims to provide clear and well-documented implementations of various data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. Each item is presented with its implementation details, time complexities, and use cases to help developers better understand and utilize them in their projects.

## Available Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures are available in this repository:

1. **Array**: A dynamic array implementation that automatically resizes as needed.
2. **Hash Table**: A hash table that stores key-value pairs and supports fast retrieval.
3. **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows push and pop operations.
4. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
5. **Graph**: An implementation of a directed graph using adjacency lists.
6. **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree data structure with efficient searching and insertion.
7. **Heaps**: Implementation of Min Heap and Max Heap data structures.
8. **Linked List**: A singly linked list that supports insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Each data structure is organized in its own module and includes examples showcasing their usage.

## Common Algorithms

This repository also includes implementations of common algorithms, such as:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
2. **Search Algorithms**: Including Binary Search.
3. **Recursion and Dynamic Programming**: Examples of solving problems using recursion and dynamic programming techniques.
4. **Graph Algorithms**: Including Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

Each algorithm is explained with its implementation details, time complexities, and usage scenarios.
